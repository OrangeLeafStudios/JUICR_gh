A basic multi-tool for Grey Hack made by an orange with a leaf🍊🍃, or otherwise, by a cloverleaf🍀

Like most custom-written tools, made for convenience (and also because I hate paying for single-use exploits :p)

Currently, it is capable of utilizing remote exploits to grant the user access to a target device in the network.

Potential features
 - LAN scanning
 - Cache for memory addresses, exploits, and passwords
 - Auto-install (and auto-delete) on target computer
 - Router targeting

## How to install
IMPORTANT: By default, the installer script installs the tool at /bin
The installer script is auto-generated by Greybel

- Go to /build & copy the contents of installer0.src
- Paste the contents in a new script in Grey Hack
- Run & enjoy!
